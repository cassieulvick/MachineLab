Next steps:
- Find good positioning for cup so that marble rolls down the ramp
- Find a way to get more force from the marble against the FSR
- Possibly add more steps
- Possibly consolidate the pushbutton, LED, DC motor, and FSR onto one Arduino
- Make more sturdy/improve visual aesthetics
- Incorporate more recycled materials

Improving reliability:
- stable ramp
- stable path for tire to follow
- protect snap action switch
- mechanism for cutting string
