![](images/finalprojectsketch.jpeg)

Parts needed:
5 FSRs, glove (or fabric to make a glove), 5 servo motors, 5 drums (combination of wood and metal...maybe cans can work as well)

Top 3 questions:
1. How can I best run 5 servo motors at one time? 
2. What material would be best for the drums?
3. Is this project feasible?
